# Iris Dataset Classification with Logistic Regression
This Jupyter Notebook classifies the Iris dataset using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
-  Jupyter Notebook
-  Required Libraries:
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * scikit-learn
    * matplotlib

## Model Used
### Logistic Regression

## Structure
Data Loading - Loads the Iris dataset using pandas.readcsv()
Exploratory Data Analysis - Provides a brief overview and visualization of the dataset.
Model Training - Trains and evaluates the Logistic Regression model with various parameters.
Evaluation - Evaluates model performance with accuracy scores on test data.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute each cell in sequence.

## Results
The notebook displays model performance based on accuracy scores, providing insights into the impact of parameter variations on classification accuracy.
